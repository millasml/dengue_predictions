# DengAI: Predicting Disease Spread - My Attempts

# Welcome!
I started on this data competition on the 4th of Febuary, 2020. It is still in progress. Check out the competition details at https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/

# First Steps
The first thing i did was train an XGBoost model because its the quickest, and I just wanted to play around for awhile. It returned with an MAE of around 15, which is not too shabby for a first try.

# TO-DO
1. Split by city
2. Complete test submission
